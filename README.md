The goal of the `forestgrowthmatrixP2` package is to provide tools to
forecast forest stocks. The forecasting functions take data in the
“matrix model” format for tree plot surveys, either CSV or R data
frames, to compute simulations for each species group.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `forestgrowthmatrixP2` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) by typing the following in the R console:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("facaimatrix/forestgrowthmatrixP2")
# Follow instructions 
```

Once the package is installed, load it into `R` with:

``` r
library(forestgrowthmatrixP2)
#> Welcome to the Forest Growth Matrix - Phase2 package!
